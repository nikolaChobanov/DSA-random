Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid with a set of coordinates and a direction.

Robots are only allowed to move in northern or eastern direction. If pointing in a southern or western direction two aditional links are returned 
First one to cancel the movement and delete the robot 
Second one to correct the robot positioning by pointing it at a correct cardinal point.
